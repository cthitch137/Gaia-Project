# Gaia-Project

The Milky Way’s disk isn’t perfectly flat, it actually warps as you move outward from the galactic center. This project will utilize Gaia’s data to map open clusters in 3D space, visualizing their vertical positions to determine whether they follow the known warp pattern seen in gas and young stars.

Galactic warp has been observed in different tracers, like neutral hydrogen gas (HI) and Cepheid variable stars. However, open clusters have yet to be fully explored as a tracer. This project will analyze their positions and create visualizations to see if they align with the expected warp trend or reveal anomalies that could indicate new physical processes. By studying these clusters, we can refine our understanding of galactic structure and evolution of the Milky Way.

**Key features and capabilities**
* Plot Vertical Position (Z) vs Galactocentric Distance (R)
  * This identifies the trends in the warp
* 3D Visualization of Open Clusters
  * Provides spatial representation of cluster positions
* Heatmap of Cluster Density
  * Highlights cluster concentration above or below galactic midplane
* (Time permitting) Investigate Age Effects
  * Check whether younger clusters follow warp more closely than older clusters

**Benefits**
* Address a less understood area of research in context of open clusters
  
* Gaia provides high quality data making this analysis more reliable than old studies

* Achievable within short time frame using standard visualizations rather than complex modeling
